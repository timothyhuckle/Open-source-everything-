What really interested me and what I wanted to explore this week was the idea of opensource technology- The way that these digital concepts could be translated into the physical world, like the exercise of drawing a house- But I was interested in how this could be combined further with more impact- to create new systems of democracy and openness.


 Open-source software that is open to be used, studied, or changed by anyone and for any purpose- this had led to remarkable developments in computing such as the Linux becoming the largest open software system in the world, anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code this being responsible for how we interact with technology in our daily lives. My research took me to explore ways in which these open-source systems can be used to solve real world problems. 
 
 
I came to a manifesto by David Steel called ‘open source everything’ applying these ideas on a huge scale- that the whole of Government should function in the most open and transparent way for opacity and secrecy leads abuses of power. More available knowledge and contribution leads to better solutions. He proposes the idea of direct democracy and bottom-up collective decision making, to combat the lack of integrity present in all parts of society from ‘banks to labour unions ‘. Critics of the work have described the writing as ‘naïve, triumphalist, and uncritical in its approach towards openness’ and having read a few chapters I can’t help but agree, the ideas lack any real grounding. Although flawed it was this way of taking computational ideas as a way of solving real world problems that lead me back to a TED talk by Hilary Cottom called ‘social services are broken’ how we fixed them. She describes a current system that is based on detachment- ineffective and not giving families affected what they need. That after spending time with those affected she understood what they really needed was their own voice to be heard and acted upon. The current system costing £250,000 a year per family and ‘Not a penny of that money touching them in a way that matters’.


So, we need a new approach. Perhaps ideas of open-source technology can be applied to create a new system. I’m sure If families or the ones affected had control of this amount of money, they We need to bring the people and the communities back into the way that we design new systems The ability to write and rewrite systems by the ones affected to meet their needs and empower them to have control of how the money Is spent and how the service act. if there was a platform (whether this be digital) in which every aspect of how money is being spent is completely transparent and available- I’m absolutely sure that the money could be so much better directed if it was done by the community with a vested interest in how their problem could be best solved and the ability to contribute to the reshaping of the system they are a subject of – in order for it to give them what they really need. Manchester took control of their own health care budget to huge success. This kind of shared voice can become possible through technology. 


When a community has a vested interest in creating a solution, there was a project in Japan that a different problem, ‘Enabling regular citizens to do the science that matters most to them has a really big impact’ regular citizens developed ways to track radiation levels themselves lower cost alternatives, and new developments, then software to compile and visualise the data. All done using opensource software they created their own solution that allowed them to track radiation levels in different parts of the city.

Giving people the tools and knowledge to create new solutions and new iterations in joint with transparency can have effective solutions and using technology as a starting point for reforming how these systems are formed and how these problems are approached. open-source technology can create a new better forms of democracy and make services better by actually allowing peoples voice to be heard, I think that these concepts of the computer can be taken further and applied to develop services and problems that don’t just exist online.
