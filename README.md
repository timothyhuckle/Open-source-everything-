### What really interested me and what I wanted to explore this week was the idea of open-source technology- The way that these digital concepts could be translated into the physical world, like the exercise of drawing a house- But how this could be combined further and with more impact- to create new systems of democracy and openness.
 
 
### I came to a manifesto by David Steel called ‘open source everything’, applying these ideas on a huge scale- that the whole of Government should function in the most open and transparent way for opacity and secrecy leads abuses of power. More available knowledge and contribution leads to better solutions. He proposes the idea of direct democracy and bottom-up collective decision making, to combat the lack of integrity present in all parts of society from ‘banks to labour unions ‘. Critics of the work have described the writing as ‘naïve, triumphalist, and uncritical in its approach towards openness’ and having read a few chapters I can’t help but agree, the ideas lack any real grounding. Although flawed it was this way of taking computational ideas and applying them to another type of problem that led me back to a TED talk by Hilary Cottom called ‘social services are broken’ how we fixed them. She describes a current system that is based on detachment- ineffective and not giving families affected what they need. That after spending time with those affected, she understood what they really needed was their own voice to be heard and acted upon. The current system costing £250,000 a year per family and ‘Not a penny of that money touching them in a way that matters.

### So, we need a new approach. Perhaps ideas of open-source technology can be applied to create a new system. We need to bring the people and the communities back into the way that we design the solution- The ability to write and rewrite by the ones affected to meet their needs and empower them to have control of how the money Is spent and how the parts of the service are utilised. if there was a platform (whether this be digital) in which every aspect of how money is being spent is completely transparent and available- I’m absolutely sure that the money could be so much better directed if it was done by the community with a vested interest in how their problem could be best solved. The quarter of a million could be used so much more efficiently- routing out the bureaucracy, inefficiency, and corruption in the current spending. 

### This isn’t an unfounded idea- when people have more control and knowledge, it leads to more efficient solutions- for example Greater Manchester was given control of its own £6 billion health budget. Which made the system more efficient, cancer waiting times are down, referrals are better than in England and mental health treatment is more available (Guardian article linked below). “Devolution allows more flexibility on how the budget is allocated.” They had a better knowledge of the community and what services would be most required.

### When a community has a vested interest in creating a solution partnered with an intimate knowledge of how it’s affecting them, they can respond more effectively. Another example is a project in Japan that applied open-source ideas to give the community a better understanding of pollution in their area. ‘Enabling regular citizens to do the science that matters most to them has a really big impact’ (Gus Arriaga, founder of Fab lab) - regular citizens developed novel ways to track radiation levels themselves and designed lower cost alternatives which were made available for people to build upon and develop. ‘Mobile units were attached to cars and bikes’. People then created software to compile and visualise the data. All done using an opensource methodology. They created and developed their own solution.

### Giving people the tools and knowledge to create new solutions and new iterations in partnership with transparency can have effective solutions and I don't think that this way of working should be just confined to technological problems. We should consider how we can use technology in a democratic, empowering, and transparent way to redevelop policy and spending relating to social problems in society. open-source technology can create a new better form of democracy and make services better by actually allowing peoples voice to be heard and giving them more control than they currently have, even if this is just a starting point to develop new solutions.
